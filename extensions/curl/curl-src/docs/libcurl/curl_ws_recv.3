.TH curl_ws_recv 3 "October 03, 2022" "libcurl 7.86.0" "libcurl Manual"

.SH NAME
curl_ws_recv - receive WebSocket data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <curl/easy.h>

CURLcode curl_ws_recv(CURL *curl, void *buffer, size_t buflen,
                      size_t *recv, struct curl_ws_frame **meta);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function call is EXPERIMENTAL.

Retrieves as much as possible of a received WebSocket data fragment into the
\fBbuffer\fP, but not more than \fBbuflen\fP bytes. \fIrecv\fP is set to the
number of bytes actually stored.

If there is more fragment data to deliver than what fits in the provided
\fIbuffer\fP, libcurl returns a full buffer and the application needs to call
this function again to continue draining the buffer.

The \fImeta\fP pointer gets set to point to a \fIstruct curl_ws_frame\fP that
contains information about the received data. See the \fIcurl_ws_meta(3)\fP
for details on that struct.
