/**
 * Use this file to configure map lists.
 *
 * Each section is a map list that plugins can use.  For example, the Admin Menu 
 * requests an "admin menu" map list, and you can control which maps appear via 
 * this file.
 *
 * Each section must have a property that explains where to read the maps from.
 * There are two properties:
 *
 *    target         - Redirect the request to another section.
 *    file			 - Read a file of map names, in mapcycle.txt format.
 *
 * There is one section by default, called "mapcyclefile" - it is mapped to the 
 * mapcycle.txt file, or whatever the contents of your mapcyclefile cvar is.
 *
 * If a plugin requests a map list file which doesn't exist, or is empty, SourceMod 
 * tries the "default" section, and then the "mapcyclefile" section.
