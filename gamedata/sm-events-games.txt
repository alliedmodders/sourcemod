/**
 * Note 1:
 * Do not edit this file.  Any changes will be overwritten by the gamedata
 * updater or by upgrading your SourceMod install.
 *
 * To override data in this file, create a subdirectory named "custom" and
 * place your own gamedata file(s) inside of it.  Such files will be parsed
 * after SM's own.
 *
 * For more information, see http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Gamedata_Updating_(SourceMod)
 *
 * Note 2:
 * When properly updating or overriding this file, also remember to update 
 * the include file here. (scripting/include/event_stocks.inc) 
 * 
 * Overriding is not recommended becuase the include file will need to be constantly 
 * updated. In the event SourceMod decides to change this file for whatever reason.
 * Should you decide to make your plugin compatible with a later build of SourceMod.
